package com.java.interfaces;

public interface BasicInterface {
	// Any number of final, static fields
	// Any number of abstract method declarations
}

// Note: An interface is implicitly abstract. You do not need to use the
// abstract keyword when declaring an interface.

// Each method in an interface is also implicitly abstract, so the abstract
// keyword is not needed.

// Methods in an interface are implicitly public.

// The variables declared in an interface are by default static and final
