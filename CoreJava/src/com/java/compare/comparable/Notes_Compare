Comparator and comparable in java are two interfaces, used to implement sorting in java

Comparator in java is defined in java.util package
Comparable in java is defined in java.lang package

Comparator has method  public int compare (Object o1, Object o2), which returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.
Comparable has method public int compareTo(Object o) which returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.

Comparator in Java compares two objects provided to the method
Comparable interface compares "this" reference with the object specified

Comparable in Java is used to implement natural ordering of object. In Java API String, Date and wrapper classes implements Comparable interface.

If any class implement Comparable interface in Java then collection of that object either List or Array can be sorted automatically by using  
Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() method and object will be sorted based on there natural order defined by CompareTo method
