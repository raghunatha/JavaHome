Collections are primarily defined through a set of interfaces.
collection is a interface implemented by all other interfaces like List,set..where as collections is a class.
Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.

A collection is a group of data manipulated as a single object. 
A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.
All collections frameworks contain the following:
	i)Interfaces :-  the abstract data types that the framework supports
	ii)Implementations :- the concrete versions of these interfaces
	iii)Algorithms :-  the predefined actions that can be defined on either the interfaces or their implementations
	
Benefits of the Java Collections Framework:
	i)Reduces programming effort
	ii)Increases program speed and quality
	iii)Reduces effort to learn and to use new APIs
