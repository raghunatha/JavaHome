static cannot be used inside a method

static variable
	i) It is a variable which belongs to the class and not to object(instance)
	ii) Static variables are initialized only once , at the start of the execution . These variables will be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables
	iii) A single copy to be shared by all instances of the class
	iv) A static variable can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object
	v) Syntax : <class-name>.<variable-name>
	
static method
	i) It is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object(instance)
	ii) A static method can access only static data. It can not access non-static data (instance variables)
	iii) A static method can  call only  other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it.
	iv) A static method  can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object
	v) Syntax : <class-name>.<method-name>
	vi) A static method cannot refer to "this" or "super"  keywords in anyway
	
static block 
	i) The static block, is a block of statement inside a Java class that will be executed when a class is first loaded in to the JVM
	ii) A static block helps to initialize the static data members, just like constructors help to initialize instance members
