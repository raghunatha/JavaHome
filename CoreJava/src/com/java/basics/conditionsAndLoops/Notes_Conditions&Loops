Statement:
	1.In programming, a statement is an instruction to do something.
	2.In Java, a statement is terminated with a semicolon and multiple statements can be written on a single line.
	3.In Java, an empty statement is legal and does nothing.
	
	
Expressions:
	1.Expressions are essential building blocks of any Java program.
	2.They are built using values, variables, operators and method calls.
	3.Some expressions can be made statements by terminating them with a semicolon.
	

Statement Blocks:
	1.You can have a block of statements enclosed between braces.
	2.If the value of expression is true, all the statements enclosed in the block will be executed.
	
	
if Statement:
	1.The if statement is a conditional branch statement. The syntax of the if statement is either one of these two
		if (booleanExpression) {
 	   		statement (s)
		}
		
		or
		
		if (booleanExpression) {
 		   statement (s)
		} else {
    		statement (s)
		}	


Switch Statement:
	1.The break statement is used to break from an enclosing do, while, for, or switch statement.
	2.'break' breaks the loop without executing the rest of the statements in the block.
	
	
Continue Statement:
	1.The continue statement stops the execution of the current iteration and causes control to begin with the next iteration.		
			

while statement:
	1.One way to create a loop is by using the while statement.
		while (booleanExpression) {
    		statement (s)
		}
	2.If there is only a single statement inside the braces, you may omit the braces.(not preferred)


do-while statement:
	1.The do-while statement is like the while statement, except that the associated block always gets executed at least once.
		do {
    		statement (s)
		} while (booleanExpression);
	2.Just like the while statement, you can omit the braces if there is only one statement within them. 
	   However, always use braces for the sake of clarity.	
	   
	   
for statement:
	1.One way to create a loop is by using the for statement.
		for ( init ; booleanExpression ; update ) {
   			statement (s)
   		}
   	2.init is an initialization that will be performed before the first iteration.
   	3.booleanExpression is a boolean expression which will cause the execution of statement(s) if it evaluates to true.
   	4.update is a statement that will be executed after the execution of the statement block.		   


for-each statement:
	1.The general form of the for-each version of the for is
		for(type variable : iterableObj) statement-block
	2.The object referred to by iterableObj must be an array or an object that implements the new Iterable interface.
