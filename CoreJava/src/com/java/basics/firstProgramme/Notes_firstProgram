Class A template that describes the kinds of state and behavior that objects of its type support.

Object is an instance of that class. That object will have its own state, and access to all of 
the behaviors defined by its class.

State (instance variables) Each object (instance of a class) will have its
own unique set of instance variables as defined in the class. Collectively, the
values assigned to an object's instance variables make up the object's state.

Behavior (methods) When a programmer creates a class, she creates methods
for that class. Methods are where the class' logic is stored. Methods are
where the real work gets done. They are where data gets manipulated.
