The widening conversion is permitted in the following cases:
	i) byte to short, int, long, float, or double
	ii)	Short to int, long, float, or double
	iii) char to int, long, float, or double
	iv) int to long, float, or double
	v) long to float or double
	vi) float to double
	

The narrowing conversion occurs from a type to a different type that has a smaller size, such as from a long (64 bits) to an int (32 bits).
In general, the narrowing primitive conversion can occur in these cases:
	i) short to byte or char
	ii) char to byte or short
	iii) int to byte, short, or char
	iv) long to byte, short, or char
	v) float to byte, short, char, int, or long
	vi) double to byte, short, char, int, long, or float
The narrowing primitive conversion must be explicit.
You need to specify the target type in parentheses.	


An automatic type conversion will take place if the following two conditions are met:
	i) The two types are compatible.
	ii) The destination type is larger than the source type.
