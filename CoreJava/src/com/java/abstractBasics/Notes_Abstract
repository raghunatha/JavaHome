Abstract

Abstract Class :
	1.Cannot create an instance for an abstract class
	2.Its sole purpose is to be extended
	3.An abstract class means the class must be extended	
NOTE: You can still use the abstract class as a declared reference type, for the purpose of polymorphism.


Abstract Methods :
	1.An abstract method means the method must be overridden
	2.An abstract method has no body, so no curly braces. Just end the method declaration with a semicolon
	3.If you declare an abstract method, you must declare the class abstract as well
NOTE: An abstract class is not required to have an abstract method in it


In Java, we can create a reference that is of type super class, to an object of its subclass

NOTE: An abstract class can have ZERO or more abstract methods. But if there is an abstract method in a class then the class must be abstract
