Enums:
	i) An enum type is a type whose fields consist of a fixed set of constants
	ii) All enums implicitly extend java.lang.Enum. Since Java does not support multiple inheritance, an enum cannot extend anything else.
	iii) The constructor for an enum type must be package-private or private access. It automatically creates the constants that are defined 
		at the beginning of the enum body. You cannot invoke an enum constructor yourself.
