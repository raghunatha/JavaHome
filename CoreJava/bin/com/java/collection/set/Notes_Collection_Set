Set:
	1.A Set is an interface that extends Collection interface.
	2.The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection, and adds the restriction that duplicate elements are prohibited.
	
	
The Java platform contains three general-purpose Set implementations: 
	1.HashSet :- HashSet is the best-performing implementation. However it makes no guarantees concerning the order of elements
	2.TreeSet :- TreeSet orders its elements based on their values. It is substantially slower than HashSet
	3.LinkedHashSet :- LinkedHashSet orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted into the set (insertion-order)
	


Ques : I have a list with duplicates and if i need to find the count the no of duplicates removed

	List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
	// list gets populated from user input...
	Set<String> set = new HashSet<String>(list);
	int numDuplicates = list.size() - set.size();
	
	//Different one chek this
	 List<String> strings = new ArrayList<String>();
 	//populate the array
 	...
 	List<String> dedupped = new ArrayList<String>(new HashSet<String>(strings));
 	int numdups = strings.size() - dedupped.size();
