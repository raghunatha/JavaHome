Shallow copy, A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object. 
If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is copied

 For Shallow copy,
 Implement the class that you want to copy with Clonable interface and override clone() method of Object class and call super.clone() in it
 
 NOTE:
 The clone method in Object looks like 
 protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;
 The above method throws "CloneNotSupportedException" to indicate that the clone method has been called to clone an object, but the object's class does not implement the cloneable interface
