Native : Native methods are platform dependent methods. Native methods does not contain body, only signature is present.
Transient : Given to variables which should not be serialized.

Volatile: volatile keyword is used to indicate that a variables value will be modified by different threads.
The value of his variable will never be cached thread-locally: all reads and writes will go straight to "main memory"
Access to the variable acts as thought it is enclosed in a synchronized block.
In general all threads will have local memory where it stores the values, but volatile variable cannot be stored in it.

Attempting to synchronize on a null object will throw null pointer exception
