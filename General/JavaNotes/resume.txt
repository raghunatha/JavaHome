JNDI : is used for service location lookup
 If you configure each app server to use the same JNDI name, you can have different databases in each environment and not have to change your code.
 You just pick up the WAR file and drop it in the new environment

SQL Injection:
http://www.imperva.com/resources/glossary/sql_injection.html
SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in a website's software
In SQl Injection the attacker injects a malicious sql that are designed to be executed with normal sql statements.
Because of this the hacker can bypass the authatication and authorization in a web site and can view the database records.
Use place holder like ? or by using :name --> called named placeholder
for ? set the values as query.setInteger(position, value);
for :name set the value as query.setInteger(placeholdername, value); --> javabrains hibernate tutorial 27
=============================================================================================
VIEW:
A view is a virtual table that consists of columns from one or more tables.

=============================================================================================
LAZY LOADING:
Lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed. 
It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used

=============================================================================================
Difference Between Delete, Trunceate, Drop
i) Delete: Data alone deleted, Doesn't perform automatic commit	.
ii) Truncating: Data alone deleted, Performs an auto commit. Faster than Delete.
iii) Dropping: Table Structure and Data are deleted.

=============================================================================================
HAVING:
Having clause is used only with group functions
Ex: SELECT Customer,SUM(OrderPrice) FROM Orders GROUP BY Customer HAVING SUM(OrderPrice)<2000

=============================================================================================
COUNT:
SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name --> null values not counted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name --> null values are counted
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM table_name --> number of distinct values of the specified column

=============================================================================================
PRIMARY Key & UNIQUE Key Differences
Both primary key and unique enforce uniqueness of the column on which they are defined
primary key doesn't allow NULLs, but unique key allows one NULL only.

=============================================================================================
JOINS:
SQL joins are used to query data from two or more tables, based on a relationship between certain columns in these tables.
LEFT JOIN:
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all rows from the left table (table_name1), even if there are no matches in the right table (table_name2)
	Ex: SELECT Persons.LastName, Persons.FirstName, Orders.OrderNo FROM Persons LEFT JOIN Orders ON Persons.P_Id=Orders.P_Id ORDER BY Persons.LastName
RIGHT JOIN:
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all the rows from the right table (table_name2), even if there are no matches in the left table (table_name1).
	Ex: SELECT Persons.LastName, Persons.FirstName, Orders.OrderNo FROM Persons RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Persons.P_Id=Orders.P_Id ORDER BY Persons.LastName

=============================================================================================
Difference Between Where clause and on clause

SELECT *
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN OrderLines ON OrderLines.OrderID=Orders.ID
WHERE Orders.ID = 12345


SELECT *
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN OrderLines ON OrderLines.OrderID=Orders.ID AND Orders.ID=12345

The first will return an order and it's lines (if any) order number is 12345. 
The second will return all orders, but only order 12345 will have any OrderLines associated with it(except for order 12345 all orders will have null for OrderLine records).	
	
=============================================================================================
In general, to process any SQL statement with JDBC, you follow these steps:
i) Establishing a connection.
ii) Create a statement.
iii) Execute the query.
iv) Process the ResultSet object.
v) Close the connection.

=============================================================================================
STATEMENT:
The Statement interface lets you execute a simple SQL statement with no parameters.
The SQL instructions are inserted into the Statement object when the Statement.executeXXX method is called.

=============================================================================================
RESULTSET:
The ResultSet interface manages access to data returned from a query. 
The data returned equals one row in a database table. 
Some queries return one row of data while many queries return multiple rows of data
	Ex: ResultSet results = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Employee ");
	Ex: String updateString = "INSERT INTO dba VALUES (some text)";
		int count = stmt.executeUpdate(updateString);
		
		while (resultSet.next()) {
			// Printing results to the console
			System.out.println("Roll No- " + resultSet.getInt("RollNo")
							+ ", Name- " + resultSet.getString("Name")
							+ ", Course- " + resultSet.getString("Course")
							+ ", Address- " + resultSet.getString("Address"));
		}
		
		Updating rows in result set
		while (resultSet.next()) {
            float f = resultSet.getFloat("PRICE");
            resultSet.updateFloat( "PRICE", f * percentage);
            resultSet.updateRow();
        }

=============================================================================================
PREPARED STATEMENT:
The PreparedStatement interface descends from the Statement interface and uses a template to create a SQL request. 
Use a PreparedStatement to send precompiled SQL statements with one or more parameters.
Use a PreparedStatement to send precompiled SQL statements with one or more parameters.
	Ex: PreparedStatement pstmt = con.prepareStatement( select userName from registration where emailaddress like ?");
		//Initialize first parameter with email address
		pstmt.setString(1, emailAddress);
		ResultSet results = ps.executeQuery();
	Ex: PreparedStatement ps = con.prepareStatement( "insert into registration(userName, password, emailaddress, creditcard, balance) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
		ps.setString(1, theuser);
		ps.setString(2, password);
		ps.setString(3, emailaddress);
		ps.setString(4, creditcard);
		ps.setDouble(5, balance);
		ps.executeUpdate();			
Once the PreparedStatement template is initialized, only the changed values are inserted for each call.
		
=============================================================================================	
CALLABLE STATEMENT:
CallableStatement cs = con.prepareCall("{call accountlogin(?,?,?,?)}");
  cs.setString(1,theuser); --> IN parameter
  cs.setString(2,password); --> IN parameter
  cs.registerOutParameter(3,Types.DATE); --> Registering OUT parameter
  cstmt.registerOutParameter(1, java.sql.Types.VARCHAR); --> Registering INOUT parameter
  cstmt.setString(4, usercity); --> setting value to INOUT parameter

  cs.executeQuery();
  Date lastLogin = cs.getDate(3);
  String cityCode = cs.getString(4);

	i) Registered via JDBC CallableStatement.registerOutParameter(index,sqlType).
	ii) Get it back via CallableStatement.getDataType(index).

HIBERNATE dynamic-insert

The dynamic-insert attribute tells Hibernate whether to include null properties in the SQL INSERT statement
	i) The default value of dynamic-insert is false, which means include null properties in the Hibernate’s SQL INSERT statement.
	ii) If set the dynamic-insert to true, which means exclude null property values in the Hibernate’s SQL INSERT statement.
Ex: <class ... table="stock_transaction" catalog="mkyong" dynamic-insert="true">

=============================================================================================
HIBERNATE dynamic-update

The dynamic-update attribute tells Hibernate whether to include unmodified properties in the SQL UPDATE statement.	
	i) The default value of dynamic-update is false, which means include unmodified properties in the Hibernate’s SQL update statement.
	ii) If set the dynamic-insert to true, which means exclude unmodified properties in the Hibernate’s SQL update statement
Ex: <class ... table="stock_transaction" catalog="mkyong" dynamic-update="true">

JAVA HEAP SPACE:
This indicates that an object cannot be allocated in the heap.
The issue may be just a configuration problem.
One more reason could be the excessive use of finalizers by the application.
jconsole management tool can be used to monitor the number of objects that are pending finalization.
maximum heap size specified by the  –Xmx
 
PERMGEN SPACE:
This the area of the heap where jvm stores its meta data
If an application loads more no of classes, then the permanent generation may need to be increased. 
–XX:MaxPermSize=n

REQUESTED ARRAY SIZE EXCEEDS VM LIMIT:
When app attempts to allocate an array that is larger than the heap size.
Caused by either the heap size is too small or a bug in calculating the array intial size incorrectly

Use stringbuffer in place of string if you are doing lots of string manipulation it will reduce memory by avoiding creating lots of string garbage.
Every time a string is modified a new string object is created(since strings are immutable). This is an overhead to GC.
Using a string buffer, the intermediate objects are not created requesting less GC. 	

try to make variable , class , method final whenever possible that’s allow compiler to do lots of optimization e.g. compile time binding so you will get faster output.
Objects with final fields can be passed from one thread to another with out synchronization. It helps robust software design.
Accessing a final member can be slightly faster than accessing a non-final member. Member variables can be declared final, unless there is a compellin reason for not doing it.	

static methods are binded at compile time while non static methods are resolved at runtime based on object type so static method will be faster than non static.

Use ternary operator when possible, where if else can be used 

don't call methods in for loop for checking condition e.g. length() size() etc. instead of doing this , use modified version
for(int i=0; i<vector.size();i++)

int size = vector.size(); 
for(int i=0; i<size;i++)

Use minimum amount of synchronization for improving the performance. 
Synchronization causes the overhead of managing the locks on the resources by JVM

Use lazy-loading of dependent objects

OutputStream can be faster than PrintWriter.

Use stateless session EJBs to cache and manage infrequently changed data. Update the EJB occasionally.

Use a dedicated session bean to perform and cache all JNDI lookups in a minimum number of requests.

=============================================================================================

CORE JAVA
**********
THREADS:
Two ways to create a new Thread of execution
i) Declare a class to be subclass of Thread Class, and the sub class should override the run method of the Thread class.
	Ex: SubThreadClass t1 = new SubThreadClass();
		t1.start();
ii) Declare a class that implements the runnable interface, then implement the run method		
	Ex: SubThreadClass t2 = new SubThreadClass();
		new Thread(t2).start();

wait() --> will wait for specified amount of time, can come out of this state in between if notify() or notifyAll() is called
sleep() --> must wait for specfied amount of time.
yield() --> a running thread goes back to runnable state, yielding(giving way) for other thread to run
join() --> allows current thread to wait indefinetly until thread "t" is finished (Doubt) can a notify command break the waiting thread?

Deamon Threads: Also called as background threads. Example GC		

SYNCHRONIZATION: 
The process of protecting resources in a multithreaded environment
With out Synchronization it is possible for one thread to modify a shared object while another thread is in the process of usng or updating the objects value,
This often causes dirty data. But synchronization can cause deadlock when 2 threads are waiting on each other for some shared resources.

Collections.SynchronizedList(myList); --> single lock for entire list

CopyOnWriteArrayList gives thread safety and immutability, so list can be used with out synchronization

=============================================================================================
CLASS LOADERS:
Used for loading classes in java.
Class loader follows a delegation model i.e they request their parents to load the class(till the top level is reached) and if that does not happen
 it itself tries to load the class
Classes which a re loaded by a class loader are not visible to its parents or siblings but only to the child.
This is how java manages namespace conflicts if multiple applications are loaded in the same instance of the application server 

=============================================================================================
JAVA RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM:
Method overriding is one of the good examples of run time polymorphism in java.
With method overriding methods are bound to object instances during run time.

=============================================================================================
SERIALIZATION:
Process by which objects are converted into a stream of bytes.(Class Instance will be serialized)
A Static variable in java cannot be serialized.
A transient variable in a class instance cannot be serialized.

=============================================================================================
STATIC IMPORTS:
The Static import construct allows unqualified access to static members

double r = Math.cos(Math.PI * theta);

import static java.lang.System.out;
import static java.lang.Math.PI;
import static java.lang.Math.cos;
...
double r = cos(PI * theta);
out.println("Blah blah blah");

=============================================================================================
MAP:
http://www.coderanch.com/t/498399/java/java/Code-store-null-keys-null
HashMap, HashTable
Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values

	Map map=new HashMap(); 
    map.put(null, "raghu"); //storing null key is allowed in hash map
	map.put(1, null); //storing null value is allowed in hash map
    System.out.println(map.get(null));
    
    Map map1=new Hashtable(); 
    map1.put(null, "ramu"); //storing null key will cause an exception
	map1.put(1, null); //storing null value is not allowed
    System.out.println(map1.get(null));
    
    Map map2 = new HashMap();  
    map2.put(null, "bob");  
    map2.put(null, "jerry");  
    map2.put(null, "kily");  
          
    System.out.println(map2.size());

=============================================================================================
SET:
Set cannot contain duplicate elements
HashSet contains null values
TreeSet cannot contain null values
	
=============================================================================================
FINAL:
A final class cannot have subclasses
A final variable cannot be chnaged once it is initialized
A final method cannot be overridden

A final method can be overloaded

=============================================================================================
EXCEPTIONS:
Checked Exceptions: These are checked at compilation time by the java compiler Ex: IOException, SQLException, MalformedURLException
UnChecked Exceptions: These are checked by the JVM Ex:ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

Throwable
	i) Error
	ii) Exception
		a)Runtime Exception
		b)Compiletime Exception

=============================================================================================
GC:
Garbage collector can be called explicitly by using the command System.gc();

=============================================================================================
Finally:

In which scenario a finally block will not be called ? 
Ans: when we call System.exit(0); --> as this method terminates the JVM

=============================================================================================
SYNCHRONIZED

A class cannot be synchronized 

Synchronized methods are used when we are sure all instance will work on the same set of data through the same function 
Synchronized block is used when we use code which we cannot modify ourselves like third party jars etc

For a detail clarification see the below code

for example:
//Synchronized block

class A
{ public void method1() {...} }
class B
{
public static void main(String s[])
{ A objecta=new A();
A objectb=new A();
synchronized(objecta){objecta.method1();}
objectb.method1(); //not synchronized
}
}


//synchronized method
class A
{ public synchronized void method1() { ...}
}
class B
{
public static void main(String s[])
{
A objecta=new A();
A objectb =new A();
objecta.method1(); objectb.method2();

}
}

=============================================================================================
THREADS
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interfere.html
http://www.codestyle.org/java/faq-Threads.shtml

First, it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object to interleave. 
When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for 
the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.

Second, when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent 
invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads

=============================================================================================
toString()

The main purpose of toString is to generate a String representation of an object, means the return value is always a String. 
In most cases this simply is the object's class and package name.

=============================================================================================
REFLECTION

Java's Reflection API's makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time

Class aClass = MyObject.class
String className = aClass.getName();
Package package = aClass.getPackage();

The methods Class.getField(String name) and Class.getFields() methods only return public fields
To access a private field you will need to call the Class.getDeclaredField(String name) or Class.getDeclaredFields() method

 The methods Class.getMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes) and Class.getMethods() methods only return public methods
 To access a private method you will need to call the Class.getDeclaredMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes) or Class.getDeclaredMethods() method

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/private-fields-and-methods.html

=============================================================================================
Making Class immutable

making the constructor alone private will not make immutable, since this class can be sub classed and methods can be overridden
Make the class Final

=============================================================================================
Can a reference be passed across JVM's? 
No. An object reference is valid only within the JVM.

=============================================================================================
How do you compare objects of String and StringBuffer?
	StringBuffer sb= new StringBuffer("Hello");
    String s= "Hello";
    System.out.println(s.equals(sb.toString())); // Prints true

StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("Java");
StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer("Java");
System.out.println(sb1 == sb2); --> false
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2)); --> false

The equals method of StringBuffer is not overridden from Object, so it is just reference equality, i.e., the same as using ==. 
I suspect the reason for this is that StringBuffer is modifiable, and overriding equals is mostly useful for value-like classes 
that you might want to use as keys (though lists also have an overridden equals and StringBuffer is kind of a list, so this is a bit inconsistent).

********
SERVLETS
********
Servlets in java are not thread safe(though they could be made threadsafe by implementing singleThreadModel
So that would mean that if there are multiple concurrent requests to the same servlet it would be served by the same instance.

XML NAMESPACE:
XML namespaces are used for providing uniquely named elements and attributes in an XML document
XML Namespaces provide a method to avoid element name conflicts.
The namespace is defined by the xmlns attribute in the start tag of an element
The namespace declaration has the following syntax. xmlns:prefix="URI"
	Ex: xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/"		
The most common URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which identifies an Internet domain address

Why web-services?
Web-services are based on service oriented architecture. They are platform independent. 
Web-services make the application highly loose coupled - for example a J2EE application can communicate with a .NET application with little effort and without any great hiccups

=============================================================================================
Can you explain under what circumstances you avoided using XML for data exchange?
I worked on a banking application which had a suite of in-built applications which were built on the J2EE architecture platform. 
And we had general wrapper value objects which could be used across applications. 
There it did not make sense to convert the value object to XML just for the sake of using XML.

LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT
http://www.javabeat.net/2007/10/life-cycle-management-of-a-spring-bean/

=============================================================================================
READING THE BEAN CONFIG FILE

ApplicationContext context = WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContext(getServlet().getServletContext());
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("com/spring/hibernate/spring-hibernate.xml");
SpringHibernateUserDAO dao = (SpringHibernateUserDAO)context.getBean("springHibernateDAO");
		
=============================================================================================
SPRING- SINGLETON		
Singleton scope in Spring means that this bean will be instantiated only once by Spring. 
In contrast to the prototype scope (new instance each time), 
request scope (once per request), 
session scope (once per HTTP session).

Singleton scope has technically noting to do with the singleton design pattern. 
You don't need to implement your beans as singletons for them to be put in the singleton scope.

In singleton, only a single instance per Spring IoC container, no matter how many times you retrieve it with getBean(), 
it will always return the same instance.

=============================================================================================
DEPENDENCY CHECKING

none – No dependency checking.
simple – If any properties of primitive type (int, long,double…) and collection types (map, list..) have not been set, UnsatisfiedDependencyException will be thrown.
objects – If any properties of object type have not been set, UnsatisfiedDependencyException will be thrown.
all – If any properties of any type have not been set, an UnsatisfiedDependencyException
will be thrown.

Try @Required annotation, it is more flexible than dependency checking in XML file, because it can apply to a particular property only.

=============================================================================================
INITIALIZATION  BEAN & DISPOSABLE BEAN:
InitializingBean and DisposableBean are two marker interfaces, a useful way for Spring to perform certain actions upon bean initialization and destruction

	i) For bean implemented InitializingBean, it will run afterPropertiesSet() after all bean properties have been set.
	ii) For bean implemented DisposableBean, it will run destroy() after Spring container is released the bean.
	
=============================================================================================
INIT & DESTROY Methods

In Spring, you can use init-method and destroy-method as attribute in bean configuration file for bean to perform certain actions upon initialization and destruction. 
Alternative to InitializingBean and DisposableBean interface

It’s always recommended to use init-method and destroy-method in bean configuration file, 
instead of implement the InitializingBean and DisposableBean interface to cause unnecessarily coupled your code to Spring.

<bean id="customerBean" class="com.spring.Customer" 
		init-method="initIt" destroy-method="cleanUp"> 
		<property name="message" value="i'm property message" />
</bean>

=============================================================================================
AUTO WIRING BEANS:
Wiring is the process of establishing linkage between two components and it is the responsibility of the developer to make this association to happen. 
Auto-wiring is the process of establishing linkage between components with the help of Spring Container without the intervention of developer
Auto-wiring can be done either by type or by name.
And if no matching found, just do nothing.

1) no – Default, no auto wiring, set it manually via “ref” attribute
Ex:- <bean id="customer" class="com.mkyong.common.Customer">
		<property name="person" ref="person" />
	 </bean>
	 
2) byName – Auto wiring by property name. If the name of a bean is same as the name of other bean property, auto wire it.
Ex:- <bean id="customer" class="com.mkyong.common.Customer" autowire="byName" />

3) byType – Auto wiring by property data type. If data type of a bean is compatible with the data type of other bean property, auto wire it.
			What if you have two beans with same data type of a class ? (like 2 bean entries for Address class with different id's)
			In autowiring by type mode, you just have to make sure only one unique data type of bean is declared.
Ex:- <bean id="customer" class="com.mkyong.common.Customer" autowire="byType" />

4) constructor – byType mode in constructor argument.

5) autodetect – If a default constructor is found, use “autowired by constructor”; Otherwise, use “autowire by type”.

In JSP's if we dont use include tags for common code like Header and Footer, the same code is being repeated across pages. So there is a code repetition.
Ex: A small change in Header or Footer would need a lot of work as we have to change in all JSP's 

include tag will resolve the above issue. But still the issue with this approach is, you create the layout of the website with in the page and then place the
actual view Component(JSP). The same layout logic is repeated in every page causing repetition in the web page. So in future if the view needs to be changed
then you may have lot of pages to modify.

With out Tiles,
1) Code repetition
2) No layout control
3) Coupling
4) Complexity
5) High costs for maintaing

"Tiles" is the solution for this problem. Tile is an area or region on the web page. Tiles is a technology which is used to create view of a website.
Using tiles you can define the layout as a template and it can be used in the application for consistent layout.
A layout contains palceholders instead of actual view components(JSPs). The values for the place holders are defined by an XML. 
If you want to change the view of the application you can do so by changing the layout only and can save lot of time
