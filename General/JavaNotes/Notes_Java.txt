Java is a programming language

What are the main modules in java?
1) J2SE -- java 2 standard edition
2) J2EE -- java 2 enterprise edition
3) J2ME -- java 2 micro edition

java software contains 
JDK -- java development kit (jdk internally contains JRE)
JRE -- java runtime environment
Current version of java is 1.7

JVM -- java virtual machine --> reads the .class file and can convert into machine language which the underlying platform can understand
jvm makes java platform independent
jvm is platform dependent making java paltform independent

All java programmes are stored in .java extenion file
when a java programme is compiled .class file is created. This file contains byte codes. This file is portable across platforms
JVM can read the .class file and can onvert it into machine instructions

============================================
Data types

int --> primitive data type --> used for simple computations
Integer -- > wrapper class --> used to store things in collection objects --> Object representation of primitive data type 
The size of int is 4bytes(32 bits). Size of Integer is also the same

String is not a primitive datatype. It is a class in java

============================================
TypeCasting

Changing of an entity from one data type to another

int x = 5;
double d = x; //compiler automatically allows this since x(4 bytes) is smaller in size than d(8 bytes)

double a = 10.4;
int b = a; // compile time error
int b = (int)a; //No error. typecasting of double to integer
============================================
Operators: ++, --, ||, &&, == ......
ex: 
++ --> increment operator
a++ means (a = a+1)

|| --> or condition
if((a>5) || (b>4)) --> returns true if either one of the conditions in the if loop are true

&& --> and condition
if((a>5) && (b>4)) --> returns true if both the conditions in the if loop are true

== --> equals comparision
if(s == 5) --> returns true if the value of s is 5

============================================
String 

String s1 = "raghu"; // creates a string pool and stores it in say 5000 memory location. so s1 will be pointing to 5000 memory location
String s2 = "raghu"; // will not assign a new memory location for "raghu", since it is present in string pool at 5000 memory location. so s2 will also point to 5000 memory location only 
String s3 = "raghu"; // s3 will also point to 5000 memory location, as per the above concept
String s4 = "Raghu"; // java is case sensitive, "raghu" is not equal to "Raghu" so again a new memory for "Raghu" will be created say 5500

String s5 = "naveen"; // creates a string pool and stores it in say 6000 memory location(since this is the first time we are creating "naveen" string.

s1 == s2 --> returns true. since == compares addresses which is 5000 for both
s1.equals(s2) -- returns true. since .equals method compares the values which these string hold which is "raghu".

String s6 = new String("raghu"); // string pool concept will not hold good here since we are saying "new", so every time you use new key word a new meory will be created assume 7000 for this s6
String s7 = new String("raghu"); // creates a new memory location say 8000 and s7 will poin to it.

s6 == s7 --> returns false. since == compares addresses which is 7000 for s6 and 8000 for s7 which are not equal
s6.equals(s7) -- returns true. since .equals method compares the values which these string hold which is "raghu".

s1 == s6 --> returns false. since == compares addresses which is 5000 for s1 and 7000 for s6 which are not equal
s6.equals(s7) -- returns true. since .equals method compares the values which these string hold which is "raghu".

Strings are immutable in java
StringBuffer is mutable
StringBuilder is mutable

Main difference between String and StringBuffer is String is immutable while StringBuffer is mutable means you can modify a StringBuffer object
You can convert a StringBuffer or StringBuilder into String by its toString() method

String is immutable while StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable objects
StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not which makes StringBuilder faster than StringBuffer

Example:
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello"); // assume that sb points to "Hello" in 1234 memory location
StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("Hello"); // assume that sb1 points to "Hello" in 5678 memory location

sb.equals(sb1); //returns false since the equals method on Object class is called which compares addresses which are 1234 and 5678

//To compare String buffer objects, first convert them to String using the toString method 
sb.toString().equals(sb1.toString())); // now the equals method in String class is called which compares "Hello" in both the objects and returns true

//The above concept of StringBuffer holds good for StringBuilder also 

============================================
arrays: 
Arrays are sequential storage of similar kind of data
int[] arr = new int[5]; //declaring an array
arr[0]= 9; //storing values
System.out.println(arr[0]); //printing the values of an array
the maximum number of values that can be stored in "arr" array is 5.
The index of the array starts from "0" and goes till "size - 1"
Arrays size cannot grow dynamically

int[] arr_new = {1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 2}; // declaring and initializing an array

int[][] arr_multi = new int[3][5]; //multi dimension arrays
The more the number of square brackets, the more no of dimensions it will be. 

============================================
Control statements -- these are not loops
1) if, else if, else
2) switch

============================================
Loops
1) for
2) while
3) do-while
4) foreach

============================================
1) break -- breaks out of the current loop -- can be used only in loops and switch
2) continue -- skips the execution of below lines of code -- can be used only in a loop  

============================================
Features of OOPS

Abstraction
Hiding the unnecessary data from the user  and exposing only essential information

Encapsulation
The process of binding code and data together in the form of a capsule

Polymorphism
The feature by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class

Inheritance
The feature that allows the same interface to be used for a general set of actions

============================================
Class:- class is a template which tells us how exactly the things will look like. 
	class will have variables and methods
Object:- the representation of a particular class in the memory is via using object

what is the memory we are taling about?
On your RAM there will be some memory allocated, called HEAP and STACK
HEAP: All the objects created in java are stored in heap
STACK: All the method level variables are stored in stack
============================================
Garbage collection

Garbage collection is automatically handled by jvm, where a deamon thread runs in the background looking for any unused objects to remove or free them from memory

============================================
Creating a class

class Employee{
 -- contains variables
 -- contains methods
}

Class name will start with a capital letter
a class is created with an extension .java

In a class file we can have any number of class files. (NOTE: all these files cannot be public)
A particular class file can only have one public class. And the public class name and the file name must be same

NOTE: A class can contain only one public class and any number of default classes -- we are not talking about inner classes here
class allows public and default as access modifiers (cannot allow private and protected)

============================================
Creating an instance of a class

ClassName objectName = new ClassName(); // creating object 
this means creating physical location in memory

Employee emp1 = new Employee(); // emp1 pointing to an Employee object at some memory location
Employee emp2 = new Employee(); // emp2 pointing to an Employee object at some memory location
emp1 will be different and emp2 will be different, since they point to 2 different memory locations

Employee emp3; // emp3 will not refer to any memory location
emp3 = emp1; // emp3 and emp1 are two different reference variables pointing to same memory location
		So if emp3 changes emp1 changes and viceversa

NOTE: if you cahnge some values in emp2 will not be reflected in emp1 since emp1 and emp2 are pointing to different memory location

Employee emp4 = new Employee(); // emp4 pointing to an Employee object at some memory location
Employee emp5 = new Employee(); // emp5 pointing to an Employee object at some memory location
emp4 and emp5 are pointing to two different memory locations
emp4 = emp5; // emp4 will now point to same memory location as emp5

Employee emp6 = new Employee(); // emp6 pointing to an Employee object at some memory location
Student stud1 = new Student(); // stud1 pointing to an Student object at some memory location
emp6 = stud1; // compilation error. since the reference variables are of different type

workspace introduction

============================================
Packages

used to group similar classes together for better maintainability
A package can contain classes and interfaces

What is the default package which is imported by your class -- java.lang package

============================================
com.rnr package
Employee class with id and name, generate getters and setters
getters and setters are used to assign values and retrieve values

The variables are made private so that they can be hidden from external usage.
The private variables are accessible only with in the class
To access private variables out side the class use their getters and setters

ctrl + Shift + f --> for formatiing the code

============================================
Access Modifiers

Public 

============================================
pojo :- plain old java objects
a simple class with variables and getters and setters
in general we will not write any business logic in these classes

============================================
How to create and object for Employee class
Employee emp1 = new Employee();

what can be accessed once an object is created?
To access variables or methods in the class we need to have object for that class
can we access all variables and methods of the class -- check this in access modifiers and scope section below

with out creating objects can we call any variables and methods ?
yes : static variables and methods can be called directly with the help of class name -- check this in static key word section below 

what are the values assigned to the variables once an object is created.
class level variables are assigned with their respective default values
Ex: default values for class level int variables are 0
    default values for class level String variables are null

How to initialize values to id and name while ceating an object
use a constructor which is parameterized
create a parameterized constructor with id and name first and then call that constructor to create an object

============================================
Methods

public void sayHello(){
-- some statements which needs to run
}

Methods will have 
access modifier(public, private, protected, default)
return type (void, int, String, .......) -- return type can be any primitive type or also any class type(like Employee, Shape.....)
method name
( ) -- which can take arguments
{ } -- defines a body for the method

Ex 1:
public void printName(String employeeName){
  System.out.println(employeeName);
}

access modifier -- public
return type -- void (which means the method is not returning any thing)
method name -- printName
arguments -- employeeName of type String
NOTE : a void method cannot contain a return statement


Ex 2:
public int addNumbers(int num1, int num2){
  return num1 + num2;
}

access modifier -- public
return type -- int (which means the method is returning an int value)
method name -- addNumbers
arguments -- num1 and num2 of type int
NOTE : contains a return statement which returns an int value


Ex 3:
public Employee getEmployeeDetails(int employeeId){
  Employee emp;
  -- some code which gets the employee record from data base and stores it in emp Object
  return emp;
}

access modifier -- public
return type -- Employee (which means the method is returning an Employee object)
method name -- getEmployeeDetails
arguments -- employeeId of type int
NOTE : contains a return statement which returns an Employee object
============================================
Constructor

constructor is a kind of method : -- it is a method with out return type

Employee emp = new Employee(); -- "Employee()" is a call to Employee class default constructor
Employee emp = new Employee(1, "Raghu"); -- Employee(1, "Raghu) is a call to Employee class parameterized constructor

constructors are used to initialize values to objects while they are being created

//default constructor -- also called as no argument constructor
public Employee() {
	
}

//parameterized constructor
public Employee(int employeeId, String employeeName) {
  this.employeeId = employeeId;
  this.employeeName = employeeName;
}

constructor has the same name as the class name
constructors are ingeneral declared public (can also be private, protected and default)
constructors can be overloaded -- check this in overload key word section below 
construcors cannot be overridden
if you dont write a constructor in your class then the compiler will write a default constructor for you
if you write any type o constructor in your class, the compiler will not add a default constructor for you
default constructor is always a no-argument constructor
every constructor by default will have a call to its super class default coastructor 
can call other constructors by using this keyword -- check this in super key word section below
can call super class constructors by using super keyword -- check this in super key word section below 

If a constructor is made private we cannot call that constructor to create an object from outside the class, since the private constructor is not visible outside.

In each and every constructor the compiler by default adds the key word super(), which means that it tries to call the super class default constructor evry time before running your constructor
If you explictly mention super() in you constructor then that line must be always the first line of your constructor, else a compilation error is shown

NOTE: to call a super class parameterized constructor, just add parameters to the super constructor like, super("Raghu") -- this calls the super class constructor which takes string as argument

To call a current class constructor from another constructor use the key word this() // "this()" must also be the first line in your constructor call
to call a parameterized constructor in the same class overload the this() call, this(2.0, "raghu") -- this calls a constructor in the current class with double and string as input arguments
NOTE: super() and this() cannot be written at the same time in a constructor
To call a parent class default constructor from your classa constructor to call a parent class constructor use the keyword super() // 

Recursive constructor invocation cannot be done(calling 1stConstructor from 2nd and again calling 2ndConstructor from 1st) -- gives compilation error

NOTE: In the lifecycle of an object the constructor is called only once
NOTE: this() and super() which are calls to constructors cannot be called from methods

============================================
Access Modifiers

public -- can be applied to class, method, constructor, variables
private -- can be applied to method, constructor, variables,inner classes
protected -- can be applied to method, constructor, variables
default -- can be applied to class, method, constructor, variables

class : - public and default
A public class can be accessed from any class
A default class can be accessed by any class with in the same package only

Methods: public, private, protected, default
public methods can be accessed in all classes
private methods are accessible only with in the same class
default methods can be accesses in classes only with in the same package
protected methods can be accessed in classes with in the same package and in subclasses present in any package

variables: public, private, protected, default
public variables can be accessed in all classes
private variables are accessible only with in the same class
default variables can be accesses in classes only with in the same package
protected variables can be accessed in classes with in the same package and in subclasses present in any package

============================================
Scope
The scope of a local variable is with in that method only

============================================
this key word

this means current class (any thing related to current class)
this.employeeId -- refers to the current class employeeId field
this.employeeId = 5; -- assigning the value 5 to employeeId field

//below example shows a method call using this keyword
public void test(){
 // some statements here
 this.print(); // call to the below print method
 // some statements here
}

public void print(){
 // some statements here
}

============================================
super key word

used to call super class variables or methods

class Shape{
  public void print(){
   // some statements here
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape{

  public void print(){
    // some statements here
  }

  public void getArea(){
    print(); // calling the current class print method
    super.print(); // calling the super class print method
    // some statements here	
  }
}

============================================
Inheritance:
Account : savingsAccount, checkings, current
Account will have generic information and all the subclasses will have some specific info related to them

class Account{

 public double getBalance(){
   //some code
 }

 public Address getAddress(int customerId){
   //some code
 }
}


class SavingsAccount extends Account {

 public double calculateInterest(){
   //some code
 }
}
NOTE: since savings class is extending Account class, the sub class will get all the features(getBalance() and getAddress()) methods in SavingsAccount class also

All classes by default extend Object class
To explictly extend a class use a keyword called extends
multiple inheritance is not allowed -- a class can extend only one class

============================================
Abstract

if you know partial implementation of a class then make the class abstract since it contains certain unimplemented methods whicha re called abstract methods.

An abstract method cannot be instantiated.
Abstract method can have Zero methods
Abstract class can have concrete methods
Abstract calss can have abstract methods
If there is atleas one abstract method in a class then that class must be declared as abstract

An abstract method will not contain body(no implementation)
public void getArea(); // example of an abstract method
The implementation for an abstract method is written in the subclass

A variable cannot be declared as abstract

============================================
Interface

An interface contains all abstrcat methods only
By default all methods are equal

An Inteface can extend multiple interfaces
A class can extend only one class
A class can implement multiple interfaces

can have only static final variables

============================================
Marker Interfaces

Empty interfaces are called marker interfaces.
It gives an indication to the jvm what needs to be done
Example : Serializable, clone 

============================================
super key word

can call super class constructors by using super keyword from a sub class constructor only
super(); // calls super class default constructor
super(1, "raghu"); // calls super class parameterized constructor

can call super class methods from a method or a constructor using super key word
super.add(); // calls add method of the parent class
super.print("raghu"); // calls print(String name) method of the parent class

============================================
static key word

class: static keyword can be applied for inner classes only
Methods: a static method is called by classname directly. A static method can call static variables and static methods only. A static method cannot call non static variables and methods
Variables : class variables are called static variables. There is only one occurence of a class variable per class. static variables can be called from static methods and non static methods also  

============================================
final key word

Class: when a class is made final it cannot be inherited(i.e cannot be extended)
Mehtod: when a method is made final it cannot be overridden
variable: makes the variable immutable

============================================
Mehod overloading

Overloading deals with multiple methods in the same class with same name but different method signature
Overloading lets you define the same operation in different ways for different data

class SavingsAccount {
public void getTotalAmount(int rate) {…}
public void getTotalAmount(int rate, long principal)
{ … }
}

getTotalAmount method in the above SavingsAccount class is overloaded

============================================
Method overriding

Overriding deals with two methods, one in the parent class and the other in the child class and has the same name and signature
It lets you define the same operation in different ways for different object types

class Account{
public void getIntrestRate(String accountType) {…}
}
class SavingsAccount extends Account {
public void getIntrestRate(String accountType) { …}
}

getIntrestRate method in SavingsAccount class is overriding the getIntrestRate method in Account class
============================================
Exception Hierarchy

Throwable is the parent class. subclasses of throwable are i) Error & ii) Exception

Error : they cannot be handled, examples: when jvm crashes, or when a database connction is lost, power failure......

Exception: They are caused by improper coding done by the usere and can be devided in to two parts i) RuntimeExceptions & ii) CompileTimeExceptions
i) RuntimeExceptions: - exceptions caught at run time Ex:ArrayIndexout of bounds, IllegalArgument, ArithmaticException
ii) CompiletimeExceptions :- exceptions that ae caught at compile time by the compiler itself. Ex:All I/O operations

try{
--
--- contains code which might throw an error
----
}catch(){
--
--- contains the steps to handle the exception
----
}finally{ // this method gets executed even if there is an exception or not
-- 
--- contains the code that must be executed when an exception occurs
----
}

try - catch - finally --> combination is valid
try - catch --> combination is valid
try - finally --> combination is valid
============================================
Throws & Throw

class Test{

public int add(int num1, int num2)throws ArithmaticException{
  // some code here
}

public void print(){
  try{
    add(1,5);
  }catch(ArithmaticException e){
    //some code here
  }
}
-- The above add method tells that it will not handle the exception instead it will tell the method which ever calls it to handle the exception 
-- So the method print which is calling the add method will catch and handle the exceptions which add method throws

Throws: I will not handle the exception, instead who ever invokes the method needs to handle it
Throw: Used to explictly throw an error
============================================
User Defined exceptions

To create our own exception class(custom exceptions), extend RuntimeException class or Exception class 
============================================
Serialization

It is the process of converting data into bytes which can be sent over network to store it either in a file or a database .....
============================================
Serializable vs externalizable

serializable is done for us but to implement our coustom serialization we use externalizable by implmenting writeexternal, readexternal

============================================
Transient

If you dont want to serailize evry thing 

============================================
MultiThreading

Difference between a thread and a process

thread is a single point of execution
process contains multiple threads

is JVM a process?
yes : it can have multiple threads to get the work done for you

instead of doing sequentially one after the other, if i want to execute concurrently so that i can get my work done at a much faster pace that is when i can use multithreading
Concurrent threads can do work paralley for you

threads are not very simple to use. 

unproper handlig of threads will lead to deadlock

threads have different states

How do you create a thread?
1) either by extending the thread class or
2) by implementing the runnable interface 

when the class implemente runnable interface, it has to override runnable interface
run method contains any piece of code that needs to be executed by the thread

someone needs to start the thread... who is going to start this thread?
There is a method called start, until unless some one triggers a method called start, that is when the code in run method gets executed


which one do you choose? either a runnable interface or extending the thread class?


public synchronized static void print(String name){
	System.out.println("Inside a synchronized method");
}
Only one thread can access this method at a time


which one is preferred? synchronized block or synchronized method?
synchronized block is preferrable since block only synchronizes the required lines of code, 
so instead of synchronizing all lines of code, sysnchronize only those lines which are required by using synchronized block


============================================
Equals & hashCode

============================================
ENUM


public Employee(int employeeId, String employeeName, String joiningDay) {
	super();
	this.employeeId = employeeId;
	this.employeeName = employeeName;
	this.joiningDay = joiningDay;
}

As joining day is a string I can pass any string value to it, but i need to restrict the input to only week days
using an enum you can make the user enter or pass only a fixed set of input(like only the days of a week for the above joiningDay)

Ex: PaymentType can take input only as Master Card, Visa, Discover, Amex

enums can be associated with some values
============================================
boxing, unboxing

int x = 5;
list.add(x); // Boxing : list can store only objects, so the primitive variable x value will be converted into object before storing in the collection object list
Integer y = 6; // Boxing : converting the primitive value to object

int i = new Integer(8) // Unboxing : assigning Object to primitive data type

============================================
annotations

Annotations convey some informative message to jvm
@override
@deprecated
@SuppressWarnings

How do we create our own annotations

============================================
Collections

expanding the size of the Array is not very easy, in the same way shrinking the size of an array is not feasible
Also sorting a array is not feasible

============================================
Generics


============================================
Core java : we write stand alone java applications and can generate jar files
J2EE applications are web applications : we can generate war and ear files for this

jar -- contains .class files
war -- contains multiple jar files
ear -- contains jar and war files

A web server can understand war file ex: tomcat
An application server can understand war and ear files

============================================

Data is stored in RAM which contains space for your OS, and Heap and Stack
