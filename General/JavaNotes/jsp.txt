JSP
Java Server Pages are a powerful way to create server-side web applications
A jsp page contains HTML code and jsp tags

Advantages of jsp over servlets
	i) jsp is the extenion of servlet technology
	ii) seperating business logic with presentation logic
	iii) jsp page is implicitly compiled to servlet class and loaded in to memory
		a) when the page is rquested for the first time after creation, or
		b) when the page is requested for the first time after modification.

The web server needs a JSP engine ie. container to process JSP pages. The JSP container is responsible for intercepting requests for JSP pages.
A JSP container works with the Web server to provide the runtime environment and other services a JSP needs. 
It knows how to understand the special elements that are part of JSPs

JSP life Cycle
	i) Page Translation :-Here the jsp page is parsed and converted to a java file that contains the corresponding servlet.
	ii) Page Compilation :- Here the servlet page that is created after translation is compiled to a class file.
	iii) Load class :- The compiled class is loaded in to the container.
	iv) Instance Creation :- The container manages one or more instances of the loaded class in	response to the requests.
	v) jspInit Method :- The initialization method gets called before any other methods. It is called only once during jsp life cycle.
	vi) _jspService :- The method gets called for each request of this jsp during its life cycle.
	vii) jspDestroy :- The method gets called when the ServletContainer decided to take the servlet out of service.
	
jsp Comments:
	<!-- This is a jsp comment -->
	
Scripting Elements: java code can be written inside the jsp page using the scriptlet tag.
	i) scriptlet tag : <% %> : used to execute java source code
		<%
			String name = request.getParameter("uname");
			out.print("Welcome " + name);
		%>
		
	ii) Declaration tag : <%!  %> : used to define variables and methods in JSP
		<%!
			int count;

			public int cube(int arg) {
			return arg * arg * arg;
			}
		%>

	iii) Expression tag : <%=  %> : used to print out a value or an expression 
		<%="Welcome " + request.getParameter("uname")%>
		<%= "The value of count is : " + count %>
		<%= "Cube of 3 is : " + cube(3) %>
		
jsp Directives:	when used affects the overall structure of the servlet class : <%@ directive attribute ="value" %>
	i) jsp page directive: Defines page dependent attributes
		<%@ page attribute="value"%>
		<%@ page import="java.util.Date"%>
		
	ii) jsp include directive: used to include the content of other resource into the current JSP page :<%@include file="relativeURL" %>
			a) If the relativeURL starts with the forward slash, it is interpreted as relative to the context of the application [context specific path], 
				otherwise it is interpreted as relative to the current JSP file.
			b) Inclusion happens at compilation time
			c) What is included is the source, not generated result
	
	iii) jsp taglib directive
