1)Difference betwen primitive and wrapper class
int --> primitive data type --> used for simple computations
Integer -- > wrapper class --> used to store things in collection objects --> Object representation of primitive data type 
The size of int is 4bytes(32 bits). Size of Integer is also the same

String is not a primitive datatype. It is a class in java

=============================================================================================
String 

String s1 = "raghu"; // creates a string pool and stores it in say 5000 memory location. so s1 will be pointing to 5000 memory location
String s2 = "raghu"; // will not assign a new memory location for "raghu", since it is present in string pool at 5000 memory location. so s2 will also point to 5000 memory location only 
String s3 = "raghu"; // s3 will also point to 5000 memory location, as per the above concept
String s4 = "Raghu"; // java is case sensitive, "raghu" is not equal to "Raghu" so again a new memory for "Raghu" will be created say 5500

String s5 = "naveen"; // stores it in say 6000 memory location(since this is the first time we are creating "naveen" string.)

s1 == s2 --> returns true. since == compares addresses which is 5000 for both
s1.equals(s2) -- returns true. since .equals method compares the values which these string hold which is "raghu".

String s6 = new String("raghu"); // string pool concept will not hold good here since we are saying "new", so every time you use new key word a new meory will be created assume 7000 for this s6
String s7 = new String("raghu"); // creates a new memory location say 8000 and s7 will poin to it.

s6 == s7 --> returns false. since == compares addresses which is 7000 for s6 and 8000 for s7 which are not equal
s6.equals(s7) -- returns true. since .equals method compares the values which these string hold which is "raghu".

s1 == s6 --> returns false. since == compares addresses which is 5000 for s1 and 7000 for s6 which are not equal
s1.equals(s7) -- returns true. since .equals method compares the values which these string hold which is "raghu".

Strings are immutable in java
StringBuffer is mutable
StringBuilder is mutable

Main difference between String and StringBuffer is String is immutable while StringBuffer is mutable means you can modify a StringBuffer object
You can convert a StringBuffer or StringBuilder into String by its toString() method

String is immutable while StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable objects
StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not which makes StringBuilder faster than StringBuffer

Example:
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello"); // assume that sb points to "Hello" in 1234 memory location
StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("Hello"); // assume that sb1 points to "Hello" in 5678 memory location

sb.equals(sb1); //returns false since the equals method on Object class is called which compares addresses which are 1234 and 5678

//To compare String buffer objects, first convert them to String using the toString method 
sb.toString().equals(sb1.toString())); // now the equals method in String class is called which compares "Hello" in both the objects and returns true

//The above concept of StringBuffer holds good for StringBuilder also 

=============================================================================================
Arrays:
Sequential storage of similar kind of data.

how to sort an array ?? --> using Arrays.sort method in java.util package

int[] grades = {1,5,2,9,4,6,2,4,5,6,2,8};
		Arrays.sort(grades);
		for(int x: grades)
		System.out.println(x);
		
To convert List to Array
String[] grades = list.toArray(new String[list.size()]);

To convert Array to List		
List list = Arrays.asList(array);

=============================================================================================		
1) break -- breaks out of the current loop -- can be used only in loops and switch
2) continue -- skips the execution of below lines of code -- can be used only in a loop
		
=============================================================================================
Features of OOPS 
Abstraction
Hiding the unnecessary data from the user and exposing only essential information

Encapsulation
The process of binding code and data together in the form of a capsule

Polymorphism
The feature by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class

Inheritance
The feature that allows the same interface to be used for a general set of actions		

=============================================================================================
what is the memory we are taling about?
On your RAM there will be some memory allocated, called HEAP and STACK
HEAP: All the objects created in java are stored in heap
STACK: All the method level variables are stored in stack

=============================================================================================
Garbage collection

Garbage collection is automatically handled by jvm, where a deamon thread runs in the background looking for any unused objects to remove or free
them from memory

can you force garbagecollection. --> yes by using a command System.gc();

=============================================================================================
System.exit(-1); --> Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. 
	The argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination.

=============================================================================================	
static key word

class: static keyword can be applied for inner classes only
Methods: a static method is called by classname directly. A static method can call static variables and static methods only. A static method cannot
call non static variables and methods
Variables : class variables are called static variables. There is only one occurence of a class variable per class. static variables can be called
from static methods and non static methods also

=============================================================================================	
final key word

Class: when a class is made final it cannot be inherited(i.e cannot be extended)
Mehtod: when a method is made final it cannot be overridden
variable: makes the variable immutable

=============================================================================================	
Abstract

if you know partial implementation of a class then make the class abstract since it contains certain unimplemented methods whicha re called
abstract methods.

An abstract method cannot be instantiated.
Abstract method can have Zero methods
Abstract class can have concrete methods
Abstract calss can have abstract methods
If there is atleast one abstract method in a class then that class must be declared as abstract

An abstract method will not contain body(no implementation)
public void getArea(); // example of an abstract method
The implementation for an abstract method is written in the subclass

A variable cannot be declared as abstract

=============================================================================================	
Interface

An interface contains all abstrcat methods only
By default all methods are equal

An Inteface can extend multiple interfaces
A class can extend only one class
A class can implement multiple interfaces

can have only static final variables

=============================================================================================	
Can a class extend multiple classes

No Class cannot extendmultiple classes, but it can implement multiple interfaces

=============================================================================================	
Marker Interfaces

Empty interfaces are called marker interfaces.
It gives an indication to the jvm what needs to be done
Example : Serializable, cloneable

Public interface Serializable{
}

=============================================================================================	
CONSTRUCTOR:

constructor has the same name as the class name
constructors are ingeneral declared public (can also be private, protected and default)
constructors can be overloaded -- check this in overload key word section below 
construcors cannot be overridden
if you dont write a constructor in your class then the compiler will write a default constructor for you
if you write any type of constructor in your class, the compiler will not add a default constructor for you
default constructor is always a no-argument constructor

use this() to call a constructor from another
use this(x) to call a parameterized constructor from another
use super() to call super class constructor from a subclass constructor
use super(a, b) to call super class parameterized constructor from a subclass constructor

=============================================================================================	
METHOD:

MethodOverloading: 
	Overloading deals with multiple methods in the same class with same name but different method signature
	Overloading lets you define the same operation in different ways for different data
	
MethodOverriding:
	Overriding deals with two methods, one in the parent class and the other in the child class and has the same name and signature
	It lets you define the same operation in different ways for different object types	

Use super.methodName() // to call a method in the super class
Use this.methodName() // to call a method in the current class	
	
=============================================================================================	
The "is a" relationship is expressed with inheritance and "has a" relationship is expressed with composition

=============================================================================================	
SERIALIZATION:
Process by which objects are converted into a stream of bytes.(Class Instance will be serialized)
A Static variable in java cannot be serialized.
A transient variable in a class instance cannot be serialized.

=============================================================================================
Transient

Applied to a variable which should not be serialized

=============================================================================================	
boxing, unboxing

int x = 5;
list.add(x); // Boxing : list can store only objects, so the primitive variable x value will be converted into object before storing in the
						collection object list
Integer y = 6; // Boxing : converting the primitive value to object

int i = new Integer(8) // Unboxing : assigning Object to primitive data type

=============================================================================================	
CLASS LOADERS:

Used for loading classes in java.
Class loader follows a delegation model i.e they request their parents to load the class(till the top level is reached) and if that does not happen
 it itself tries to load the class
Classes which are loaded by a class loader are not visible to its parents or siblings but only to the child.

System Class loader --> Extensions class loader --> Bootstrap class loader

=============================================================================================
CLASS LOADING:

Static Class loading: 
	Classes loaded using the new operator
	Student student = new Student();

Dynamic Class loading:
	Programatically invoking the classes at runtime
	Class studentClass = Class.forName("com.rnr.Student");
	Student student = (Student)studentClass.newInstance();
	
=============================================================================================	
JAVA RUNTIME POLYMORPHISM:
Method overriding is one of the good examples of run time polymorphism in java.
With method overriding methods are bound to object instances during run time.

STATIC binding & Dynamic Binding
=============================================================================================
STATIC IMPORTS:
The Static import construct allows unqualified access to static members

double r = Math.cos(Math.PI * theta);

import static java.lang.System.out;
import static java.lang.Math.PI;
import static java.lang.Math.cos;
...
double r = cos(PI * theta);
out.println("Blah blah blah");

=============================================================================================
ACCESSMODIFIERS

1) Public --> Methos and variables can be accesed by any class in the same package or outside the package
	Public Access is valid for --> Outer classes, inner classes, constructors, interfaces, methods, class level variables 

2) Private --> Methos and variables cannot be accesse by any one out side the class
	Private Access is valid for --> inner classes, constructors, methods, class level variables 

3) Protected --> can be accessed by classes in the same package and any other sub classes present in different package
	Protected Access is valid for --> inner classes, constructors, methods, class level variables 

4) default --> can be accessed by classes only with in the same package 
	Protected Access is valid for --> Outer classes, inner classes, constructors, interfaces, methods, class level variables 

=============================================================================================
INNER CLASSES

class Outside{
class Inside{
}
}

=============================================================================================
WRAPPER CLASSES:
Wrapper Classes are classes that allow primitive types to be accessed as objects

=============================================================================================
MAP:
http://www.coderanch.com/t/498399/java/java/Code-store-null-keys-null
HashMap, HashTable, TreeMap are the concrete implementations of Map interface

Hashtable is synchronized, whereas HashMap is not.
Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. HashMap allows one null key and any number of null values
TreeMap is sorted based on the keys --> does not allow null keys

	Map map=new HashMap(); 
    map.put(null, "raghu"); //storing null key is allowed in hash map
	map.put(1, null); //storing null value is allowed in hash map
    System.out.println(map.get(null)); //prints raghu
    
    Map map1=new Hashtable(); 
    map1.put(null, "ramu"); //storing null key will cause an exception
	map1.put(1, null); //storing null value is not allowed
    System.out.println(map1.get(null));
	
	Map map1=new TreeMap(); 
	map1.put(null, "ramu"); //storing null key will cause an exception
	map1.put(1, null); //storing null value is allowed
	System.out.println(map1.get(1));
    
    Map map2 = new HashMap();  
    map2.put(null, "bob");  
    map2.put(null, "jerry");  
    map2.put(null, "kily");            
    System.out.println(map2.size()); //prints size as 1

=============================================================================================
SET:
Set cannot contain duplicate elements, The ordering of elements is not maintained
HashSet, TreeSet --> some of the concrete implementations of Set Interface
HashSet allows one null value
TreeSet cannot contain null values, and tree set is sorted
	
=============================================================================================
List:
List Allows duplicate elements, ordering of elements is maintained, can caotain multiple null values
ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList --> concrete implementations of the list object 
Vector is synchronized
ArrayList is not synchronized

=============================================================================================
ENUMERATION, ITERATOR, LISTITERATOR

ENUMERATION: it is a read only interface by which you can enumerate the elements in a collection of objects
	The two main methods in it are	
	hasMoreElement()
	nextElement()	
	
ITERATOR: Used to iterate over collection objects in one direction
	The main methods present in that are
	hasNext()
	next()
	remove() //can modify the collection	

LISTITERATOR: Used to iterator over collection objects in both directions
	next()
	previous()
	
=============================================================================================
How to synchronize collection objects

 Map myMap = Collections.synchronizedMap (map); // single lock for the entire map
 List myList = Collections.synchronizedList(list); // single lock for the entire list
 Set mySet = Collections.synchronizedSet(set); // single lock for the entire set

=============================================================================================
COMPARABLE & COMPARATOR

Comparable and comparator are interfaces used to implement sorting in java

Comparator :
	present in java.util package
	public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) --> compares two different objects

Comparable : 
	present in java.lang package
	Generally used to implement natural ordering of elements
	public int compareTo(Object o)	--> Allows itself to compare with another similar object

=============================================================================================
Concurrent Modification Exception

The java.util Collection classes are fail-fast, which means that if one thread changes a collection while another
thread is traversing it through with an iterator the iterator.hasNext() or iterator.next() call will throw
ConcurrentModificationException

=============================================================================================
FINAL:
A final class cannot have subclasses
A final variable cannot be chnaged once it is initialized
A final method cannot be overridden

A final method can be overloaded
=============================================================================================
Finally:

In which scenario a finally block will not be called ? 
Ans: when we call System.exit(-1); --> as this method terminates the JVM the finally block wil not be called

=============================================================================================
Finalize:

Finalize methods are invoked by garbage collectors prior to reclaiming the memory occupied by the object 
=============================================================================================
EXCEPTIONS:
Checked Exceptions: These are checked at compilation time by the java compiler Ex: IOException, SQLException, MalformedURLException
UnChecked Exceptions: These are checked by the JVM Ex:ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

Throwable
	i) Error --> they cannot be handled, examples: when jvm crashes, or when a database connction is lost, power failure......
	ii) Exception --> They are caused by improper coding done by the user and can be handled
		a)Runtime Exception --> Ex: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds, NumberFormatException .....
		b)Compiletime Exception --> Ex: All IOExceptions
		
try - catch - finally --> combination is valid
try - catch --> combination is valid
try - finally --> combination is valid	

=============================================================================================
Throws & Throw

class Test{

public int add(int num1, int num2)throws ArithmaticException{
// some code here
}

public void print(){
try{
add(1,5);
}catch(ArithmaticException e){
//some code here
}
}
-- The above add method tells that it will not handle the exception instead it will tell the method which ever calls it to handle the exception 
-- So the method print which is calling the add method will catch and handle the exceptions which add method throws

Throws: I will not handle the exception, instead who ever invokes the method needs to handle it
Throw: Used to explictly throw an error

=============================================================================================
User Defined exceptions

To create our own exception class(custom exceptions), extend RuntimeException class or Exception class

=============================================================================================
THREADS:
Two ways to create a new Thread of execution
i) Declare a class to be subclass of Thread Class, and the sub class should override the run method of the Thread class.
	Ex: SubThreadClass t1 = new SubThreadClass();
		t1.start();
ii) Declare a class that implements the runnable interface, then implement the run method		
	Ex: SubThreadClass t2 = new SubThreadClass();
		new Thread(t2).start();

wait() --> will wait for specified amount of time, can come out of this state in between if notify() or notifyAll() is called
sleep() --> must wait for specfied amount of time.
yield() --> a running thread goes back to runnable state, yielding(giving way) for other thread to run
join() --> allows current thread to wait indefinetly until thread "t" is finished (Doubt) can a notify command break the waiting thread?

Deamon Threads: Also called as background threads. Example GC		

SYNCHRONIZATION: 
The process of protecting resources in a multithreaded environment
With out Synchronization it is possible for one thread to modify a shared object while another thread is in the process of using or updating the objects value,
This often causes dirty data. But improper synchronization can cause deadlock when 2 threads are waiting on each other for some shared resources.

Collections.SynchronizedList(myList); --> single lock for entire list
CopyOnWriteArrayList gives thread safety and immutability, so list can be used with out synchronization

=============================================================================================
SYNCHRONIZED

A class cannot be synchronized 

Acquires a lock on the class for static methods.
Acquires a lock on the instance for non static methds.

For a detail clarification see the below code

for example:
//Synchronized block

class A
{ public void method1() {...} }
class B
{
public static void main(String s[])
{ A objecta=new A();
A objectb=new A();
synchronized(objecta){objecta.method1();}
objectb.method1(); //not synchronized
}
}


//synchronized method
class A
{ public synchronized void method1() { ...}
}
class B
{
public static void main(String s[])
{
A objecta=new A();
A objectb =new A();
objecta.method1(); objectb.method2();

}
}

=============================================================================================
THREADS
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interfere.html
http://www.codestyle.org/java/faq-Threads.shtml

First, it is not possible for two invocations of synchronized methods on the same object to interleave. 
When one thread is executing a synchronized method for an object, all other threads that invoke synchronized methods for 
the same object block (suspend execution) until the first thread is done with the object.

Second, when a synchronized method exits, it automatically establishes a happens-before relationship with any subsequent 
invocation of a synchronized method for the same object. This guarantees that changes to the state of the object are visible to all threads

=============================================================================================
toString()

The main purpose of toString is to generate a String representation of an object, means the return value is always a String. 
In most cases this simply is the object's class and package name.

=============================================================================================
REFLECTION

Java's Reflection API's makes it possible to inspect classes, interfaces, fields and methods at runtime, without knowing the names of the classes, methods etc. at compile time

Class aClass = MyObject.class
String className = aClass.getName();
Package package = aClass.getPackage();

The methods Class.getField(String name) and Class.getFields() methods only return public fields
To access a private field you will need to call the Class.getDeclaredField(String name) or Class.getDeclaredFields() method

 The methods Class.getMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes) and Class.getMethods() methods only return public methods
 To access a private method you will need to call the Class.getDeclaredMethod(String name, Class[] parameterTypes) or Class.getDeclaredMethods() method

http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/private-fields-and-methods.html

=============================================================================================
Making Class immutable

making the constructor alone private will not make immutable, since this class can be sub classed and methods can be overridden
Make the class Final

=============================================================================================
Can a reference be passed across JVM's? 
No. An object reference is valid only within the JVM.

=============================================================================================
How do you compare objects of String and StringBuffer?
	StringBuffer sb= new StringBuffer("Hello");
    String s= "Hello";
    System.out.println(s.equals(sb.toString())); // Prints true

StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer("Java");
StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer("Java");
System.out.println(sb1 == sb2); --> false
System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2)); --> false

The equals method of StringBuffer is not overridden from Object, so it is just reference equality, i.e., the same as using ==. 
I suspect the reason for this is that StringBuffer is modifiable, and overriding equals is mostly useful for value-like classes 
that you might want to use as keys (though lists also have an overridden equals and StringBuffer is kind of a list, so this is a bit inconsistent).

=============================================================================================
CLONING:
ShallowCopy vs DeepCopy
http://www.jusfortechies.com/java/core-java/deepcopy_and_shallowcopy.php
