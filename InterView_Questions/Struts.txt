1) version of struts used : --> say 1.3 to be on safer side

2) Architecture of struts (explained taking in to consideration aa ActionClass, servicelayer and DAOlayer)
	When the user submits the form, the request comes to the application, 
	based on the mappings(urlpattern mapping) present in the web.xml file the request is validated,
	If the request is validated then the control is given to ActionServlet(provided by struts)
	ActionServlet takes the control, reads the struts-config.xml(for all mappings like form-beans, action-mappins, message-resources, plugins, and so on...)
	And based on the action the ActionServlet forwards the request to specific ActionClass
	From Action Class the control goes to serviceLayer 
	From ServiceLayer to DAOlayer
	From DAOLayer back to Service
	From ServiceLayer back to ActionClass
	ActionClass returns a mapping object and based on the mapping object the ActionServlet displays appropriate view to the user 	
	
3) What is MVC
	Model : Encapsulates the state of the application. Business logic, data processing etc all are done here
	View : Provides the presentation interface to the user. HTML, JSP pages
	Controller : controls the application flow. Action Servlet
	
4) What is ActionServlet
	A servlet given by struts framework for managing the control for the application

5) What is ActionForm
	ActionForm is a java bean which binds the form data coming from the view and gives the same data to the action class

6) What are the important methods in ActionForm
	validate() : Used for validating the form data and returns ActionErrors object
	reset() : used to reset all of the ActionForm's data prior to the new request values being set

7) what is the role of an Action Class
	An Action Class performs a role of an adapter between the contents of an incoming HTTP request and the corresponding business logic that should be 
	executed to process this request.
	In an Action class the execute() method is called, where the business logic is written

8) Explain Struts-config.xml
	An xml file where all the formBeans, action mappings, message-resources, plugins and so on are declared
	
9) Can we have more than one struts-config.xml files in a single application
	Yes, And to use them declare it in the web.xml init-param tag which is given to ActionServlet
	
10) Difference between session scope and request scope of a form bean
	when the scope is request,the values of formbean would be available for the current request.
	when the scope is session,the values of formbean would be available throughout the session.	
	
11) what is DispatchAction
	DispatchAction class is used to group related actions into one class

12) What is ForwardAction
	Used to forward the request to a resource in your application, like a jsp page with out writing an action class
